# AgroGuide â€“ AI Farming Assistant

AgroGuide is an AI-powered farming assistant built entirely on IBM Cloud to deliver real-time, hyperlocal agricultural guidance to small-scale farmers, home gardeners, and spiritual plant users across India. Built using IBM Granite, Watson NLP, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AgroGuide integrates live data sources such as AgMarknet, IMD weather, and ICAR crop APIs. The platform features a full-featured multilingual **frontend chat UI** for smartphone and web access, optimized with IBM no-code tools for rural environments.
